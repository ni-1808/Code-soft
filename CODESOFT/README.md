\# 🤖 AI Internship Projects – CODESOFT



Welcome! This repository contains the Python-based mini projects I completed during my \*\*Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodeSoft\*\*.



These projects demonstrate foundational skills in AI, machine learning concepts, and logical programming using Python. Each project was designed to build real-world problem-solving abilities and showcase how AI can be used in day-to-day applications.
