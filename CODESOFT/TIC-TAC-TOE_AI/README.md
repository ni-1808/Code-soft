# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax AI

🎮 A command-line based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game in Python featuring an unbeatable **AI opponent** using the **Minimax algorithm**.

## 💡 Project Description

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring it never loses. This project was created as part of my internship and demonstrates practical use of decision-making algorithms in game logic.

## 🚀 Features

- Command-line interface
- Unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
- Dynamic gameplay with user input
- Automatic draw and win detection
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python code

## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is represented as a list of 9 elements.
- The AI evaluates all possible game outcomes using the Minimax algorithm.
- It chooses the best move to either win or prevent the player from winning.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the Python file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-minimax.git
cd tic-tac-toe-minimax
